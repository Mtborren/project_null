    // [ '-]? allows for a space, an apostrophe, or a dash to be optional after the first 0-30 character letters are input; Ex. just in case someone's first name is D'Angelo and their last name is Richard-Johnson; however, it doesn't allow for repeat spaces, apostrophes or dashes.
    // [a-zA-Z]{2,30}$/ allows for a user to input more letters if a space, an apostrophe, or a dash is used; this is also so users with names that do not contain apostrophes, hyphens, or spaces can input 2-30 character letters; note: a first or last name cannot end with an apostrophe, a dash, or a space.
