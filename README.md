​
- For our group project, we elected to incorporated the COVID-19 Virus that has gripped the nation. At the beginning of week 7 of CBC class#8, we found ourselves in a strange predicament. The class had to be done remotely which I believe was new to all of us. Plus, we now had to work as a "team" strictly in an on-line environment. A group project is enough of a challenge without that variable added to it. Our goal was to have a landing page that took a user's name and phone number and stored the information into a database.
​
- I just took a look at the almost finished product. The name fields can't be left blank and the number field requires hyphens so the regex is working properly. A window pops up letting you know your errors and a welcome window pops up when you have entered the information correctly. 
​
- The page was developed using ***Heroku, MySQL, JawsDB, JavaScript*** and some other colorful languages that we can't use here.
​
- ***Heroku*** is development center that allows you to build applications. It proved to be very difficult to navigate but once we all managed to do it, it seems better. I personally have only started playing around in it.
​
- Taron Head developed the database using ***MySQL*** and connected it to the ***JawsDB***
​
- I was supposed to try to connect Taron's database to a ***JavaScript*** file but was unable to do so and Tyler Borren had to take that over from me. JavaScript is your "go to" source for the colorful language!
​
- The frontend developers Tywanda Harmon collaborated on the page styling. Chanice Ward handled the ***JavaScript*** for the page.
